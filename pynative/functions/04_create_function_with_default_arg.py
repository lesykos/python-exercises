# Exercise 4: Create a function with a default argument
# Write a program to create a function show_employee() with the following specifications:
#
# It should accept the employee’s name and salary.
# It should display both the name and salary.
# If the salary is not provided in the function call, it should default to 9000.

def show_employee(name, salary = 9000):
    print(f"Name: {name}, salary: {salary}")

show_employee("Ben", 12000)
show_employee("Jessa")
